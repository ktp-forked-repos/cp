Competitive Programming
=======================

Repository to store my solutions to algorithmic and math
problems on sites such as Codechef, SPOJ, codeforces, Project Euler etc.

## Nicks

I mostly solve problems on CodeChef, SPOJ and Codeforces. I have
accounts on other sites too, mostly by one of these names only.

* CodeChef: [paramsingh](http://codechef.com/users/paramsingh)
* SPOJ: [paramsingh](http:/spoj.com/users/paramsingh)
* Codeforces: [prmsngh](http:/codeforces.com/profile/prmsngh)

## A Question A Day

I have been trying (and mostly failing) to solve one problem a day
for some time. This would ideally mean one commit to this repository
per day.

## Languages

I mostly use C++, though I have used C, Python and Java when I
found a use case for them. Also experimented a bit with Haskell.

## Contributions

Because this is a repository for archival purposes mostly, please
refrain from opening pull requests here.
